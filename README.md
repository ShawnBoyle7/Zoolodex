## What is Zoolodex?

Zoolodex is a full stack application that serves as an educational platform to satisfy curiosity towards wildlife and nature. You can browse articles to understand the origins, traits, and modern influence of the animal kingdom on their ecosystems. You can discuss these articles in a comment section as well. If you're interested in browsing a region these animals may be located in, there is a gallery of regions to choose from. Don't see an animal or region you love or would like to know more about? Submit a suggestion on the website to let me know! If you want to know if it's been suggested already, you can view the suggestions submitted by users filtered by animals or regions. If you want to quickly find the animal or region you're looking for. You can view your own details regarding just your suggestions, and soon your most recent sighting. Don't know where to start? The splash and home page will give you some direction!

## Conclusion and Future Plans

Conclusion goes here

In the future, I'll be integrating a Google Maps API represented at the center coordinates of said region. You will be able to explore this map to see the locality of the region, as well as post or view live sightings of wildlife in that region represented as a clickable node with coordinates on the map. These nodes contain photos and a description of the sighting which you'll be able to comment on as well.
I'll soon have a search feature which you can filter by many criteria such as a region's name, climate or continent, or traits of an animal such as their name, regions or physical attributes.
